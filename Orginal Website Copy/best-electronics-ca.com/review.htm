&quot;For anybody who prefers a joypad style controller for playing Atari, it really 
doesn't get any better than the slick and ergonomic Atari Jaguar controller pad 
from the 1990's. I haven't played a Jaguar since 1998, so I had completely 
forgot how comfortable the Atari Jaguar pad feels in adult hands. The pad moves 
extremely smoothly and the buttons offer a nice solid feel. I was able to 
achieve much higher scores on Pitfall II and Keystone Kapers using the Jag pad, 
and it feels as solid and as comfortable as it always did back in the 90's. 
Awesome build quality on the adapter cable as well, so glad to be able to use a 
great joypad-style controller for when a particular Atari game calls for it!&quot;</span></b></span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Imagine my surprise a few weeks ago when a friend mentioned that he had heard about a
cable that will let you use an Atari Jaguar Controller on any of the other Atari
Game/Computer Systems (except for the 5200). I called the manufacturer, Best Electronics,
and ordered one promptly. It arrived a few days later and I set forth to put the cable
through its paces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">I admit I was a little skeptical at first, but this is one high-quality, professionally
made piece of equipment. The molded cable is expertly produced and houses all the
Electronics needed inside. This is NOT some hack job! I tested this cable thoroughly with
the 2600,7800,8-bit, and ST systems and it Performed spectacularly. Basically, you have
use of the Directional Joypad and the &quot;B&quot; (fire) Button. ST/TT users also have
access to the &quot;A&quot; Button which is the equivalent of the right mouse button. The
cable does have some trouble with a couple of 7800 games due to the way the 7800 is set up
to read 2 joystick buttons, but most Operate Flawlessly. In the course of my testing, I
tried a random sampling of games on the 2600. Everything from Space Invaders to Crazy
Climber worked Perfectly. The ST games also handled Well. My real treat though, came from
using the cable with my Atari 800XL computer. Being a big 8-bit Gamer/Collector, the true
test for me would be playing the Classics on my XL. Imagine playing Miner 2049er or Bounty
Bob strikes Back with the Jaguar Pad. Easy, fluid control of the characters is achieved
effortlessly. All the Classics were a Joy to Play. Qix, Dig Dug, Star Raiders, Pengo, Pole
Position, Final Legacy, even Pac-man. I could go on and on (or One-on-One). As far as the
Jaguar Pad goes, you either love it or you hate it. I think most people are like myself
and really enjoy the feel of the Jagpad though. I can't say it enough: If you like the
Jagpad and have some of the other systems listed, you have to have this cable! Best
