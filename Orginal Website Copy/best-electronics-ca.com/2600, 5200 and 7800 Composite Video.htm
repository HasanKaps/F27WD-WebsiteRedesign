<p align="center"><font face="Arial Black" size="6" color="#0033CC">How to get 
Composite video out of the older Atari 2600, 2600A, 2600JR, 5200 and 7800 
consoles.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Composite video is just about an 
industry standard on most modern Video (LCD, LED, Plasma TV's, Video players and 
Current State of the Art Video game consoles) equipment now a days.&nbsp; But 
when the Atari 2600 consoles were first conceived close to 30 years ago, the 
composite video standard was not used widely for stand consumer based video 
products and may have been only used in very high end and very expensive type of 
industrial Video equipment.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Back when the Atari 2600 consoles 
were released, <b>RF</b> (<b>R</b>adio <b>F</b>requency) TV Broadcasting (TV 
grade broadcast Signals) thru the open air, was the industry standard for 
broadcasting TV <b>RF</b> signals to US TV's.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are older, you 
will remember most US houses back in that era had a standard Metal TV antenna on 
the top of the roof.&nbsp; These <b>RF </b>TV metal antennas would collect the
<b>RF</b> TV Broadcast signals in the open air at the house Roof level and thru 
a twin lead wire hook up connect to the back of the standard US TV <b>VHF</b> (<b>V</b>ery
<b>H</b>igh <b>F</b>requency) Input on the back side of Black + White and later 
Color US TV sets.&nbsp; Now a days, most of those old House TV metal antennas 
are being replaced with direct Satellite Dish's or Direct High Speed Cable 
connections from a Media provider.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">The newer (or back when it was 
released) Composite Video Standard was considered a better video connection 
because is took the older RF signals and changed them into a single Composite 
Video Signal (less subject to the RF Interference and video problems and video 
distortions) and a Mono sound output.&nbsp; Newer composite video equipment has 
an added feature of Stereo (left and right or more) sound outputs jacks.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">If you search the Internet and sites 
like E-Bay you will find hacker type kits (requires soldering, internal 
components added, cuts + jumpers added to the motherboard and extra boards added 
to the Atari 2600, 5200 or 7800 motherboard) so you can install a composite 
video output to those Atari consoles.&nbsp; Now you will find even newer S-Video 
kits for the Atari 2600, 5200 and 7800 consoles.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">In most cases these video upgrade 
kits seem to work fine, but are not for the average Video game owner who can not 
solder.&nbsp;&nbsp; We at Best have been giving the following <b><u>
<font color="#0000FF">free Atari Tech</font></u> </b>to our Atari customers for 
over 12+ years now.&nbsp; The easiest and most cost effect way to get Composite 
video out of your old Atari 2600, 5200 or 7800 consoles (without any internal 
changes or hacks) is to connect them up to an old VCR, Video CD Player or older 
DVD player.&nbsp; All of this older type of video equipment has an RF in 
connection (usually a Coax /&nbsp; Antenna In) a Composite video and audio out 
and Coax to TV Output connections (this out to TV connection not used or needed 
for the Composite tip).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Connect up your Atari 2600, 5200 or 
7800 console Via a Cable Ready TV switch box (make sure the little slide lever 
on the top of the TV switch box is switched to game position) to the VCR Coax In 
/ Antenna in connection of your VCR or old Video equipment.&nbsp; Then connect 
up a RCA to RCA Male to Male cable to the VCR's Composite Video out and a second 
RCA cable Audio out (you may have to try both audio Left or&nbsp; Right if you 
have more than one before you get a good audio out connection) connectors and 
then connect the other RCA male ends to your input composite video and Audio 
input connectors on your LCD, LED, Plasma or high end Display.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Turn on your Atari console with a 
game cartridge installed, again check the Cable Ready TV switch box lever on the 
back of the VCR, turn on the old VCR or other Video equipment.&nbsp; Now 
depending on the exact era the VCR or other video equipment was made, it might 
auto detect the Atari Game Console TV channel 2 or 3 RF channel broadcast signal 
and auto lock on to it (and give you a clear composite output video signal) or 
you may have to go into the old VCR's set up menu and to a new TV Channel scan 
(like most of the newer Cable ready TVs have to have done, before it can lock 
onto the Atari console exact RF broadcast signal and put it into it Channel 
memory chip) before you will get a good composite video and audo output to your 
newer LCD, LED or high end display.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">You should be able to pick up an old 
VCR, Video CD or DVD Players for next to nothing now.&nbsp; Most electronic 
recycling centers have tons of them and should give you one for next to free.</font></p>

comment we get here at Best.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q.</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I love my Atari 2600, 5200 or 7800 console connected up to my high end larger 
display.&nbsp; But the video display is not like my other newer Media devices 
displays?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#0000FF"><b>A.</b></font> 
This is normal.&nbsp; You must consider you are taking an old 25+ year TV device 
that was designed to display so many hundreds lines or pixels across an older 
12, 15, 19, 25 inch TV screen and you are now trying to input it into a current 
High Def. display that has 10X or maybe 100X more screen resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So you will see a little more larger pixels (from the older Atari Consoles) on 
your modern display (compare to a High Def. display) simply because that is the 
only fixed screen resolution an old Atari game console can broadcast at.&nbsp; 
Most cost effective modern Video equipment will not scale up (change / convert 
the lower pixel count up) the lower input screen resolution.&nbsp; Most will 
display the lower resolution in the same display space with just larger pixels.</font></p>
