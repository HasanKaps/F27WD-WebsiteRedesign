<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Over the years we have had thousands and thousands of questions from <b>Atari
Owners</b> and former owners who are trying to connect up their old Atari 2600 /
2600A / 2600Jr system or other Atari Console they dug out of their parents house (or a used Atari
system they just picked up) back up to their Cable Ready TV, LCD / LED Display.</font></p>
 </font>
<p><font size="4"><font face="Arial">Now to clarify a couple of points and to give us a good starting point, Atari
Made many many different Atari products over the years.&nbsp; One of the most popular
(and one we get a lot of requests for information on) was the <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Atari
2600</font> Video Computer System (VCS), second generation <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Atari
2600A</font> and third Generation slim line <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Atari
2600Jr</font> models</b>.&nbsp; You can tell
which Atari model product you have by the label on the bottom of the Atari
Product.&nbsp; If this label is missing <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#007f00">(Some 
of the 2600/2600A models are getting close to 32+ years old now and the Product
labels have just simply fallen off)</font></b> another quick way
you can tell if you have an Atari 2600 or 2600A model is, they all have a brown
wood grain trim on the front of the console, with a sliver Atari logo on the
right hand side (a few of the last Atari 2600A models made had an all black
front panel with the silver Atari Logo on the left hand side <b>(Atari 2600
Collectors call this the “Darth Vader” 2600A Collector Model)</b>.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Another way you can tell the Atari 2600/2600A models apart from other Atari
products made is the Atari 2600 model had three silver slide switches on either
side of the Game Cartridge port in the middle of the console <b> (6 total)</b>, the
Atari 2600A models had two Slide Switches on either side of the Game Cartridge

Tip Information:&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial">Just about all older Tube TV's, 
1st Generation Flat Panel and State of the Art HD Flat panel TV's do not auto 
detect when a new device (like the Atari consoles) are connected up to for the 
1st time.&nbsp; So if you are currently using the HDMI In port only or Composite 
Video ports only on your Flat panel TV and try connect up your Atari console to 
the RF / Antenna In female coax connector (via a Cable Ready Atari TV Switch 
box) in the back of your Flat Panel TV, you will not see any 2600 game display.&nbsp; 
You must you use your TV's Remote Control (to get into your TV set up menu) and 
tell your TV display to access the Antenna in port (usually called TV or TV 
port) or Composite Video A, B and so on input port (for Atari 2600, 5200 and 
7800 consoles that have had a Composite Video mod installed).&nbsp; So remember 
next time you want to use your Atari console on your TV display, to switch input 
from what you are currently using (like HDMI port) to the Antenna in or CV ports</font></span></p>

</font></b><font face="Arial">The Radio Frequency (RF) Modulated TV signal that 
the average Atari Console outputs thru it RF out RF RCA male single cable is 
like an old TV Station broadcast signal.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an RF Modulated 
Signal (Combined Video and Audio Signals in to a singe TV Broadcast RF signal) 
which once received by your TV / Display (RF Coax in connector) and has to be 
demodulated into a separate Video and Audio Signals within your TV display 
electronics before you can see a display on your TV / Display.&nbsp; That is the 
reason why when you try to connect up your old Atari console single RF Broadcast 
signal cable up to the Modern Composite Video <font color="#FBD142"><b>(Yellow)
</b></font>Female RCA connector standard you do not see any display.&nbsp; The 
newer Composite <b><font color="#FBD142">Video</font></b> and <b>
<font color="#FF0000">Audio</font> </b>Standards were invented and started to be 
used on most electronic devices about 10 to 15 years after most of the 1st Atari 
Game consoles were invented.&nbsp; When you get a weak, no Video or Sound on 
your modern TV / Display, one of the reasons is because one or more of the old 
Atari consoles separate / different RF Modulated Video and separate Audio 
signals are not broadcasting on the Original Atari Factory set RF TV standards

automatically electronically lock onto a off frequency RF TV broadcast Video or 
off frequency Audio RF signals, hence why you get a first poor Video, Audio or 
both.&nbsp; By doing a new channel scan on your Modern TV / Video display, you 
force your TV / Display to lock onto the exact RF Video and separate Audio 
frequencies your Atari Console is broadcasting at and then store that new channel 
frequency information into its TV Channel Information memory chip. </font></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><font face="Arial Black">Atari Tech 
Tip Information:&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial">Some of the very last large 
tube TV's made and some of the new Flat panel TV's do not have the same good RF 
Internal shielding (Metal RF cages that surround or fully cover all of the 
Electronics / Printed circuit boards that produce RF interference inside your TV 
and will broadcast RF interference outside the backside of your TV back case) 
which would normally suppress normal RF interference compared to early 
made Color TV's.&nbsp; So it is possible to install a new cable Ready Atari 
Universal TV switch box on the back side of your current TV and still get some 
RF interference on your Atari console TV display.&nbsp; One way we have found 
that will help this RF Interference that radiates from the back side of your 
newer TV, 
is to use a short 3 to 6 foot Coax extension cable to move the Cable Ready Atari 
Universal TV switch box away / down from the back side of your TV.&nbsp; Sometimes just 
moving the TV switch box (acts like a TV Antenna that sucks in RF interference 
into the tv switch box) a few inches or few feet away from your TV display will 
fix the minor RF interference problem in most cases.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><font face="Arial Black">Atari Tech 
Tip Information:&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial"><b>S</b>ince you can not see 
normal RF Interference per say, it is best to think of it as an invisible cloud 
that radiates out of just about every device that uses electricity.&nbsp; Some 
devices have a large cloud of RF interference (poor RF shielding inside that 
device) cloud sounding that device and some small electrical devices have very 
little RF cloud / foot print.&nbsp; Since RF can penetrate thru just about 
anything (walls, roofs, doors and so on) it is possible to have RF Interference 
source in the next room / apartment next door or even outside your house (High 
Power Lines, TV transmission Towers, Cell Towers, Airport towers, Ham Radio 
antennas).&nbsp; You can have a lot of different RF clouds in your area that can 
add up to one very big RF invisible cloud which can effect your 30+ year old 
Atari 2600 console, which was never designed to suppress that amount of RF 
Interference. It was simply not a major problem 30+ years ago when the Atari 
engineers 1st designed the 2600 console.&nbsp; If you think this might be the 
case for&nbsp; you, contact Best Electronics, we have written an Best Atari Tech 
tip article on how to suppress RF Interference in your location based on Atari 
customer RF problems for the last 31+ years.</font></span></p>

</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#0000FF"><b>A.&nbsp;</b></font> At worst case to verify that your Atari 2600 is working, try it on an older /
another Color TV (<b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#007f00">without the Auto Scan
Mode / CPU with channel memory feature</font></b>).&nbsp; </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">First try one
of those old color TV’s with the round channel selector knob with the outer
fine tuning ring. Set the TV for Channel 2 or 3, turn on the 2600 (double check
the TV switch box setting) and turn the outer fine tuning ring to tune in your
Atari 2600 channel 2 or 3 broadcast signals.&nbsp; If you do not have this type of
Older color TV, then try a Color TV with individual TV Station Channel buttons.
Each channel button has it own tuning button or knob to manually turn in a clear
TV station.</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="4"><font face="Arial">Based on Thousands and Thousands of Atari 2600 Console repairs over the last
31+ years, it is <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Very Rare</font></b>
that even a <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Bad </font></b>2600
console <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#007f00">will not</font></b>
display something on the TV screen if all of the Connections, TV settings and TV
switch boxes are set up right. In most cases when a <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">bad
</font></b>Atari 2600 console is turned on (<b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#007f00">with
a good 2600 game cartridge installed</font></b>), the TV screen will
usually go from displaying White TV Snow and Normal static sounds on the TV screen
to a completely Black, Gray or other color screen with no sounds or funny
sounds.&nbsp; That shows that the Atari 2600 is broadcasting a TV signal but there is
no 2600 Game Display / Signal because of a 2600 motherboard problem.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font face="Arial">If you still get nothing out of your used Atari 2600 console then most likely
you have a <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Bad</font></b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>or wrong<font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>power supply, <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Bad</font></b>
2600 Power Jack, <b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Bad</font> </b>2600 On/Off switch,
<b><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Bad</font></b>
RF cable or <b><font color="#FF0000">Bad</font></b> TV switch box.&nbsp; A quick 
test for the 2600 Internal Right Angle female power jack, when you insert the 
male plug of the 2600 external power supply into the female power jack, the male 
end should slide into the 2600 power jack and you should feel some resistance 
back as the male tip of the power supply connector locks / snaps into place 
inside the 2600 female power jack.&nbsp; If the male end of the 2600 Power 
supply connector slides in and out of the R/A female connector opening very 
easily with no resistance, usually what has happened, is because of poor contact 
between the Male Power connector end and the female opening on the R/A 2600 
power jack, the spring metal contact inside the 2600 power jack has heated up 
(or shorted or arced internally, which you can not see) and has caused the 
internal mating spring metal contact inside to heat up and loose is spring / 
pressure.&nbsp; The old 30+ Atari 2600 R/A power jack should be replaced with a 
new one.&nbsp; Another way to verify this 2600 Power Jack problem, is to play 
the Atari 2600 as normal, but touch the Atari 2600 black power jack housing as 
it goes into the Atari 2600 console, if the 2600 shuts down or the 2600 game 
screen glitches or freezes up, you have a going back 2600 internal Power Jack.</font></font></p>

On some older (25 - 28 year old Atari 2600 consoles) that have a perfect video
