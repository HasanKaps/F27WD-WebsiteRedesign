I took the consul apart and found the 3 soldered joints ...They looked fine ... But I moved the jack and noticed a bit of movement in the 3 prongs ... So I did a nice job re soldering them ... Reattached the system to the TV ... Put in a cartridge and turned it on ... And guess what ??? Looks like the system was made yesterday ... YAHOO...My 11 year old&nbsp; grandson is very happy ... He says he would some day like to pass it on to his children ... Imagine an 11 year old today wanting to even bother with that old system ... Hope you have a great day ... You sure made mine ...

say with such quick service, excellent packaging, how you take orders the good 
old fashioned way over the telephone instead of through some impersonal online 
form, and of course the fact you're probably the <br>closest thing to &quot;factory direct&quot; Atari products still in existence, that you've

TX</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>&quot;As always, everything arrived very quickly, 
professionally packaged, and in perfect condition, just as described on the 
website.&nbsp; The Epyx 500XJ joystick is the absolute BEST joystick for playing 
any version of Pac-Man on an Atari!&nbsp; It offers a nice 'clicky' tactile feel 
that can't be matched on any other joystick, believe me, I've tried nearly every 
other one and nothing comes close to the Epyx 500XJ! Worth every penny!&quot;&nbsp;
										<font color="#0000FF">Benjamin got one of Best Atari new Jaguar Power pad and 
adapter cable to other Atari systems Combo special.</font>&nbsp; &quot;The BEST 
Custom made Jaguar Pad Adapter: For anybody who prefers a joypad style 
controller for playing Atari, it really doesn't get any better than the slick 
and ergonomic Atari Jaguar controller pad from the 1990's.&nbsp; I haven't 
played a Jaguar since 1998, so I had completely forgot how comfortable the Atari 
Jaguar pad feels in adult hands. The pad moves extremely smoothly and the 
buttons offer a nice solid feel. I was able to achieve much higher scores on 
Pitfall II and Keystone Kapers using the Jag pad, and it feels as solid and as 
comfortable as it always did back in the 90's. Awesome build quality on the 
adapter cable as well, so glad to be able to use a great joypad-style controller 
for when a particular Atari game calls for it!&nbsp; All of the Atari 2600 games 
I ordered arrived in mint condition and still sealed in their factory laminate, 
which is quite amazing when you remember how old many of these games are. 
There's nothing quite like opening a brand new Atari game for the first time and 
experiencing the excitement of putting a brand new game into your Atari console. 
I get all kinds of flashbacks from the 80's whenever this happens and it's 
always such a thrill to receive brand new games from such a great source!&nbsp; 
Keep up the great work and thanks for being such a solid and reliable source for 
all my Atari needs!&quot;</p>

		explained to Joe that all Atari CX52 Joysticks Bests reconditions are 
		tested on Atari Factory consoles that are calibrated to Atari 5200 
		Engineering Spec's using Atari 5200 Diagnostic hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		During the Best reconditioning process, each reconditioned Atari CX52 
		Joystick is tested on several different Atari 5200 Consoles using 
		several different Atari 5200 Game Cartridges and then are put into our 
		stock.&nbsp; Just before the Reconditioned CX52 Joysticks are sent out, 
		they again go into our Atari Tech's area to be again tested on Factory 
		spec Atari 5200 consoles.&nbsp; We explained to Joe, that we have found 
		over the last 25+ years selling Atari CX52 Joysticks, that some of the 
		Atari 5200 consoles have electronically drifted off the Atari 5200 
		Factory Joystick port settings, casing the one reconditioned CX52

		do the minor internal setting adjustment over the phone within his 5200
