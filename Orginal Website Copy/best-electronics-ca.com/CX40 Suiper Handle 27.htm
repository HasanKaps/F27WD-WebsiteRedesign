exposed studs) method that used 4 springs (about a ¼ inch in diameter) on the 
bottom solid non flexing ring of the CX10 handle.&nbsp; The bottom of each spring 
would push directly into a white or black plastic actuator plate that had 5 
flexible spring holding cups / arms, that in turn would push directly onto the 
top of unique CX10 PCB board (which are not interchangeable with the newer CX40 
Joystick PCB boards) dome contact / mechanical mini switches.&nbsp; With nothing but 
constant in field / in use failure problems (actuator plate arms not properly 
pushing down on the CX10 PCB board dome contacts) on the original 6 switch 2600

the old Atari CX40 PCB boards would invert (go from a concave shaped dome 
contact to a failed inverted convex dome contact, as the clear tape covering 
over the dome contact would fail / pull away / off the dome contact).&nbsp; When the

with enough force or over pressure (because of the stock Atari CX40 inner PCB

cause it to fail / turn inside out on the top of stock Atari CX40 Internal PCB

<h4><font size="5">Instead of the Atari CX40 handle raised small tit on a half round stud

generation wider outer rings versions and the final generation 4 lobes / arms 
Atari designed handles bottom rings all flexed to some degree when they come in contact the 
inner CX40 PCB dome contact top surfaces and came to a soft&nbsp; X / Y stop.&nbsp; So 
when you moved the stock Atari CX40 Handle in any X / Y direction, the bottom of the 
Joystick handle ring with the stud would push on the CX40 internal PCB board dome contact (make the 
switch contact / circuit) and the CX40 handle would still flex or over flex just 
a little, to gave that Joystick handle direction a soft direction stop.&nbsp; With the 
very stiff / hard 1<sup>st</sup> article sample Best CX40 </span>

soft bed vs jumping up and down on a sold cement floor.&nbsp; You can jump 
and down on the soft bed for 
hours with no problem, but jumping up and down on a cement floor you could not do for very 
long without fatiguing your legs.&nbsp; Although that stiff CX40 handle would last the average 
Atari CX40 Joystick user 5X to 6X

After a couple of weeks of long life continues cycle tests, close up

find some other low density Polypropylene formulations that would correct these

reviewed our test report with photos and did some more research.&nbsp; They said 
they found 2 higher grade LDPE plastic molding compounds that should fix the 
minor cracking problem on the bottom of the joystick ring.&nbsp; But of course 
the two new molding compounds are more expensive than any of the plastic molding 
compounds they have used to date.</b></font></p>

the cost of shipping them to Best.&nbsp; Like all of 
the other past Joystick handle test shots, they had to be paid up front again, 
before the samples could be shot / molded.&nbsp; On April 13, 2017 Best sent the 
funds to the plastic molder for the new test shots.&nbsp; On May 2, 2017 Best 
received the 7th article samples of the Best CX40 Super handles and started to 
long term extended cycle testing of them. </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">On May 11, 2017 after 9 days of 
continues cycle testing of the new 7th article sample handles everything seemed 
to be going well on both of the new molding compounds.&nbsp; All X / Y Joystick 
/ Atari game functions were functioning fine.&nbsp; But when we opened up the 
all the functioning CX40 Joystick samples, we received a big surprise.&nbsp; 
Both the new handles of both new molding compounds had cracks (but not 
completely open cracks) in the outer joystick thicker bottom rings.&nbsp; A 
little more on one new Molding compound and less on the other.&nbsp; But on both 
of the different CX40 
Super handles test samples, the X / Y CX40 PCB board dome contacts still worked 
fine.&nbsp; On the stock made Atari CX40 handles when the thin bottom ring, any 
cracks on this very thin outer ring, meant the CX40 dome contact near that crack 
just stopped working (not&nbsp; properly actuate / press on the CX40 PCB dome 
contact) and usually you would hear / feel a clicking sound (as the 
broken parts of the outer ring would flex / rub against each other) coming from 
the inside of the CX40 Joystick during normal use / play.&nbsp; To Best this latest 7th 
article CX40 Joystick handle early test results, meant the Redesigned and Upgrades 
on the Best CX40 Super Handles, were a </font></b><u>
<font face="Arial Black" color="#000080">Fault Tolerant</font></u><font face="Arial"><b> 
Engineering design, they keep working fine, even with cracks in the outer 
joystick bottom ring.&nbsp; All that was needed to finally put this Best CX40 
Super handle 
project to bed, was to find the right new plastic molding compound that would 
not crack with any normal use / play.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">So another 7th article sample 
receiving report was sent to our plastic molder.&nbsp; The main suggestion Best 
sent to the plastic molder, was to check the plastic compound used on the 
different Atari OEM CX40 handles we sent them a year+ ago and see of they could 
match or find a newer generation of that plastic molding compound for the Best 
CX40 Super Handles.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">Late May 2017 early June 2017, we 
started to have commutation problems with our Plastic Injection Molder.&nbsp; 
E-Mails were not being returned to Best.&nbsp; We came to the conclusion that 
this plastic molding vendor had given up trying to find the right plastic 
injection molding compound to make the Best CX40 Super Handles.&nbsp; So the for 
the very 1st time in 34 years in the Atari business, we had to drop the current 
Plastic Injection Molder and start looking for a new Plastic Injection molder to 
take over this project.&nbsp; In the meantime, Best filed a dispute with the 
Injection molder which to this date, has not been settled.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">Best knew finding a new Plastic 
Injection Molder to take over our Best CX40 Super Handle project was not going 
to be an easy task.&nbsp; Most Injection molder companies are reluctant to take 
over a new plastic product from another Injection molder.&nbsp; So searching 
thru 15 to 20+ new Injection molders for the next two months, Best convinced a 
new Plastic Injection Molding company that the new Best CX40 Super CX40 Handle 
Mold / CX40 handle was a proven approved design and it was simply a matter of 
finding the right Plastic Molding compound to make the new CX40 handles.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">So late September 2017 our new 
Injection molder had picked up the new Best CX40 Super handle mold and sample 
old CX40 Joysticks and old Atari CX40 handles we sent to the 1st Injection 
molder, old from the 1st Injection molder.&nbsp; They were ready to run some new 
sample plastic molding compounds thru the mold.&nbsp; Again Best sent funds $$$ to 
the new Injection molder for the new plastic handle samples and shipping costs 
to Best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">Although Best fully explained to the 
new Injection Molder all of the problems we had with the last CX40 handle 
samples from the old Injection molder, the 3 new molding compounds CX40 sample 
handles Best received the second week of September 2017 were totally not useable 
at all.&nbsp; It was like taking a 10 month back step and starting all over with 
the new Injection molder.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">After months and months of 
communications back and forth with the New Injection molder, they said they 
found a new plastic molding compound.&nbsp; Again Best sent funds $$$ to the 
New Injection Molder for a second set of sample handles and shipping costs to Best.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">The 1st week of December 2017, Best 
received the latest CX40 Super handle samples.&nbsp; The new CX40 Super Handle 
samples fixed one of the problems on the 1st article handles had from our new 
Injection molder.&nbsp; It again 
give the CX40 Done contact click sound on the CX40 internal PCB board.&nbsp; But 
the second problem on the 1st article sample handles was improved, the flexing 
of the 4 bottom arms on the CX40 handles.&nbsp; But was still to stiff to meet 
Bests requirements.&nbsp; In theory these stiff CX40 handles would last the 
average CX40 a lifetimes worth of normal use, but because of the stiffness (hard 
stop vs a soft stop) of the CX40 bottom arms, the CX40 Joystick user hands would 
get very tired very fast with any normal use.&nbsp; Best sent this little 
flexing information problem back to our New Injection molder to help them find a 
softer plastic molding compound to fix this very last problem with Best CX40 
Super handles. </font></b></p>

Plastic Injection molder from another test shot of both of the new plastic 
molding compounds and shipping of those new samples to Best.&nbsp; On February 
2, 2018 Best received the latest sample Joystick handle samples.&nbsp; It ended 
up we only received a single type of new molding compound sample CX30 handles.&nbsp; 
Again, the new sample molding compound was again to stiff and did not allow the 
new Best CX40 Super handle 4 bottom arms to flex up and down.&nbsp; Again, the 
latest new stiff sample Joystick handle would last the average Atari CX40 
Joystick user a lifetimes worth of normal use.&nbsp; But because of the 
stiffness of the CX40 handle, your hands would get very tired / fatigued very

the 1st Plastic Injection molder did.&nbsp; Not listening to our requirements

had to make a hard decision to settle with the sample CX40 handles we had 
received so far, which we do not

Middle of May 2018 we decided that we must approach the New Plastic Injection 
molders a completely different way / method to find the one that would work with 
us.&nbsp; For the third time, we put out a request for a new Injection Molder 
for our CX40 Super handle project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again another 18 to 20+ New 
Plastic Injection Molders contacted Best.&nbsp; We sent all of them, a new set 
of requirements for the Super Joystick handle.&nbsp; Out of all of those New 
Injection Molders, only one contacted Best and by their responses to our 
E-Mails, Best felt that they could meet our requirements.&nbsp; They said their 
Plastic Molding compound Engineer found 3 new flexible Plastic Molding compounds 
that should meet our flexing requirements, but they required the New Joystick 
mold to proceed.</font></b></p>

cost to have the New mold shipped to 2 different injection molders, without

The 3rd new Injection molder was refusing to sign this release without seeing the 
new mold 1st.&nbsp; Being very very experienced with this type of vendor 
disputes, Best has worked here in Silicon Valley for different manufacturing 
companies handling / settling this type of Vendor / Company type of disputes.&nbsp; 
We suggested a compromise / method to the new 3rd Injection molder that should 
make both vendors happy and get the new Joystick mold shipped to the new 
Injection molder.&nbsp; After a week of back and forth between Best and two 
Injection molders, Best agreed to pay a mold shipping charge ($$$) to the second 
plastic molder to release the mold.&nbsp; Next came a requirement from the 2nd 
molder to sign a release, regarding any possible damage to the mold during 
shipping.&nbsp; Instead of requiring the 3rd new Injection Molder sign the 
shipping waver, Best agreed to sign the release form, if the second plastic 
molder paid (Best had to pay this extra amount) for shipping Insurance.&nbsp; 
The final requirement from the 2nd plastic molders was a crating charge to make 
a wooden shipping box ($$) for the Joystick handle mold, which Best agreed to 
pay to the second plastic molder to finally get the Best CX40 Super Handle mold

After several more days of continual testing we noticed same minor white stress 
marks on the bottom ring of the one promising flexing Joystick sample handle.&nbsp; 
Also we noticed a major crack in several of the bottom joystick ring studs.&nbsp; 
Examing the same lot of one of the untested flexible joystick rings, under a microscope, we 
noticed a knit line in the plastic Joystick bottom ring exactly in the same 
exact area where the joystick stud started to crack in half.&nbsp; A knit line, is a 
plastic Injection molding term, that means when the very hot injected plastic 
molding material is injected into a closed mold like into a ring shape, one of the 
paths of the hot injected molding material is heading / flowing in a clock wise direction 
around the ring and the other path of the hot molding compound is heading into 
the ring counter clock wise.&nbsp; Where they meet is a knit line location.&nbsp; 
Plastic Injection molders have many ways (control how fast the hot plastic is 
injected into the mold, Mold temperature, cycle time, how long the hot plastic 
molded part is left inside the mold before it is ejected out of the mold and 
many more techniques) they can control how well the two 
hot molding blend together if they know about a cold knit line problem.&nbsp; A cold 
knit line in plastic molded parts look perfectly fine / good under normal visual 
inspection, but under normal working conditions like the flexing Joystick bottom 
ring over years of use / time, will fail or crack eventually.</font></b></p>

different molding compound sample handles so far.&nbsp; A half day latter their 
Plastic compound molding Engineer got back to Best with some suggestions to 
correct the sample Joystick handle problems.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">A few Best rejected (redesign 
the Joystick bottom ring so it no longer had a floating ring but was a solid piece of the 
Joystick bottom bell shape) a few we agreed they can try on the next run of 
sample Joystick handles.&nbsp; Another suggestion they made was to get away 
from the original Atari Joystick handle plastic molding compound / material (that was 
State of the Art plastic molding compound Atari used back 35+ years ago) to a 
newer plastic molding compound.&nbsp; So for the 4th or 5th time during this 28 
month Best CX40 Super handle project, Best agreed to a new plastic molding 
material change.&nbsp; Best has always known that a new plastic Injection mold designed for one type 
plastic molding compound / family of plastic molding compounds (with their different shrinkage rates, flow rates within the mold 
and other plastic material properties during the injection molding process) can possibly cause a whole new set of 
possible injection molded part problems, some of which would require physical 
modification / tooling change to the new Best CX40 Super Handle mold to get a 
proper working Joystick Handle.&nbsp; 
Another gamble and cost to Best.&nbsp; </font></b>

<b><font face="Arial" size="5">Day 6 of the continuous cycle / game testing of 
the CX40 Super handle Joysticks, Engineering dissembled all test CX40 Joysticks 
and each well used Best CX40 Super handles was inspected under magnification for 
cracks, white stress marks and any distortions on the bottom joystick rings.&nbsp; 
To our surprise not a single New CX40 Super Handle sample showed any of the 
standard failure problems that all of the CX40 Super Handle past samples have 
shown for the last 29+ months of the CX40 Super Handle project.&nbsp; With this 
promising test results so far, the CX40 Super handle well used samples were again 
installed back into the CX40 Joysticks and the continuous cycle / game testing 
continued.</font></b><font size="5" face="Arial Black" color="#006600"> </font></p>

same disassembly / Inspection process was again done and again not a single 
problem was detected.&nbsp; At this point Best Engineering felt this new plastic 
molding compound was the best choice for the Best CX40 Super handle.&nbsp; 
Although they said, they would still continue the long life cycle testing for 
the rest of the month.&nbsp; Engineering sent a new 1st article receiving report 
back to our New Injection Molder telling them this was the approved plastic

testing and user testing of the final Best CX40 Super handle samples, another 
Quality Assurance inspection was done on the test CX40 handles, same test 
results, no stress marks were found on the bottom ring of the Joystick handles.&nbsp; 
Best estimates the continuous cycle testing and user testing done so far, would 
be equal to about 2 to 3+ years of normal to hard Atari CX40 Play / Use.&nbsp; 
At this point in the testing, Best was comfortable giving the final approval of 
this New plastic molding compound to our new Injection molder.&nbsp; Although 
Best continued with the continuous cycle testing and user testing to see when 
the new CX40 Super Handles would start to show any white stress marks on the 
bottom Joystick ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b></p>

for the different scheduled (over a couple of months) shipments of New 2018 Best
