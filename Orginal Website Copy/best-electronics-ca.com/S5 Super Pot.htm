or three times the original Atari cycle life, all of the Atari Paddle users / 
owners wanted to upgrade their old failing CX30 Paddles.&nbsp; After 5 to 7+ years of 
selling the Best CX30 Super Pots, we knew we were going to finally run out of 
the Best CX30 Super Pots late 
2014.&nbsp; We went back to our original Super Pot manufacture.&nbsp; They said they could 
only make a new production run of 30K Super Pots with plastic threaded boss vs 
the Die Cast threaded boss on the old 1<sup>st</sup> generation Best Super 
Pots.&nbsp; We told them we could not use Pots with plastic threaded boss.&nbsp; So early 
October of 2014 Best again started to search for new Pot vendor.&nbsp; See the 
information on the original / 1<sup>st</sup> 7+ year search to find the original

Best 1<sup>st</sup> CX30 Super pot</a></u>.&nbsp; Even back 7 years ago, the Pot 
industry was a shrinking industry, with major equipment manufactures switching 
to variable resistance electronic type of circuits instead of the old technology 
of the variable resistance Pot adjustments.&nbsp; Think of an old tube TV with 
volume (Pot) control knob vs a newer solid state newer TV with on screen 
(sliding volume bar display) digital electronics volume up 
and volume down functions, so you can see why the Pot industry was shrinking</font></span></b></p>

(less and less companies making pots</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="1">&nbsp;
</font></span><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="5">any more) and 
getting smaller every year.&nbsp; So we knew were 
going to have an even harder time trying finding a new Super Pot Manufacture in 
the ever-shrinking pool of world wide Pot Manufactures.&nbsp; Mid October 2014 Best 
traveled to Far East to go to 3 different large Electronics trade shows to 
search for new Pot manufactures.&nbsp; Thousand and thousands of vendors at those 3 
very large Far East Electronics Trade shows, we only found 2 total Pot vendors 
(sales representatives companies for pot vendors, Pot manufactures stopped going 
to the large Far East trade show, about 10+ years ago) who said they might be 
able to make the Super Pots for us.&nbsp; In the end both of them ended up saying 
they could not make our Best CX30 Super Pots for us because the quantities needed 
were too small for them to produce.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically they wanted Best to buy a 20 to 
25 year supply of Super Pots before they would make a new production run of them 
and there were not interested in small qty buys at all.</font></span></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="5">Best Electronics has buying and having new Atari replacement parts made from 
the Far East for over 27+ years now.&nbsp; The way most Far East vendors do business 
have evolved (before the Internet and Internet age) over those many years.&nbsp; Now 
most companies now hire in new house sales people to do business over the 
Internet with very little background in technical knowledge or sales 
experience.&nbsp; In the old days Far East companies would hire technically educated 
sales people like sale engineers who could answer all of your product and 
technical questions (via Telex, International Phone Calls, next Fax or even snail 
mail) very easily and could tell you right off, if there company can make the 
product or item you want.&nbsp; Now any person or small Far East company with 
Internet access can try to get your business even though they have never made 
the item or product before.&nbsp; They put up 20 to 30 different web sites with 
pretty pictures of everything under the sun, hoping to get any order off the 
Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them will take your order and then end up subcontracting out 
the job to another company that actually makes the product you are looking for.&nbsp; Hence the time delay (weeks to months) to your 
technical questions, Engineering prints you request or getting any kind of 1<sup>st</sup> 
article samples out of the in a timely matter.&nbsp; In the old days, you could place 
an order with a Far East company within weeks of 1<sup>st</sup> contacting 
them.&nbsp; Now that interface time is now stretched out to months and months of 
sorting thru and dealing with potential new vendors and want to be vendors before you narrow down your 
final vendor choices.&nbsp; So when searching for a new Far East vendor, Best has now 
learned to ask enough questions of a potential new Far East vendor to tell if 
Best is dealing direct with a major part manufacture or want a be person / 
small company with absolutely no experience making the item you want.&nbsp; Sorting 
thru the different price quotes you get (from so low there is no way you they 
can possibly make them for that price and expect any type of Quality, to price 
quotes higher that what you retail them for).&nbsp; Then there is dealing with 
minimum amounts of parts (60K, 100K, 1 Million) the different manufactures 
require before they would even talk to you.&nbsp; Any new tooling required for that 
part much be paid for up front.&nbsp; In the old days most Far East companies would 
send you any amount of no charge samples you asked for.&nbsp; Now all Far East 
companies make you pay up front ($$ to $$$) for any samples you want and also 
the air freight shipping costs to ship them you on top of that.</font></span></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="5">So now when you contact a Far East company for the products they 
make or list at their web site, the non-technical sales people will tell you any 
thing you want to hear from them (sometimes you think they are paid on the 
volume of quotes they send out and not on actual orders placed).&nbsp; Yes we can 
make that item for you.&nbsp; You send prints, product spec’s to them, pictures and 
ask 20 to 50+ questions over weeks / of months of correspondences back and forth 
with that company and you get close to placing an order with that Far East 
Company, and the sales people finally talk to the Engineering department, sales 
managers of the company or sub contractor about the new order you are about 
ready to place and then that company decides they can not make that product for 
you.</font></span></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="5">Best had contacted at least 2 different pot companies late 2014 
and went thru the normal dance with their sales departments only to find they 
could not make the Super Pots we required.&nbsp; We went thru this same dance at 
least 12 to 16+ times with other Far East Pot vendors for most of 2015.</font></span></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="5">Mid January 2015 Best thought we found a new Pot Manufacture we 
could work with.&nbsp; For the next two months we worked with them, sending technical 
Information, samples sent to us and rejected and then some final samples we 
accepted.&nbsp; So early in March that Far East Pot Company sent us an E-Mail Invoice 
for the new production run of Super Pots we required.&nbsp; We had our bank, wire 
transfer funds to their company bank account.&nbsp; About a week later that Pot 
Company contacted us and said their E-Mail server had been hacked into and the 
information on their invoice was changed.&nbsp; The company bank account number had 
been changed.&nbsp; Long story made short, Our bank would not due any thing to try to 
get our funds back and the new Pot company would not do any thing for us also.&nbsp; 
So after 3 months wasted work with that new Pot vendor, another 1½ months trying 
to recoup the lost funds, we had to finally give up and write off the funds as 
gone forever.&nbsp; Best had to start to search for a new Pot vendor all over again!</font></span></b></p>

that would extend the useful life of a pot from the industry standard of 10K to 
100K test cycles.&nbsp; We would say about 95% of the Far East Pot Manufactures Best 
contacted over the last 19+ months either do not know about this new long life 
Pot Material or was not interested in making an upgraded long life Pots for

cycle test rotates the sample pot shafts to about 340 degrees (to 1 Meg 
resistance) and back to 0 degrees (0 resistance), then 340 degrees again over 
and over.&nbsp; To get to the 100K cycle test mark, requires about 3 ½ weeks (the 
same time frame the 1<sup>st</sup> Pot manufacture we found January 2015 
required to run their long life cycle tests) of 24 hours per day, 7 days a week 
of continuous cycle testing.&nbsp; Think of it as using an Atari C30 paddle for over 
1 month solid non stop 24 hours a day of continuous play.&nbsp; Pot electrical tests 
parameters are measured on the newly assembled 1 meg pot samples and the same 1

<font size="5">About a month and half talking to the latest potential super pot 
manufacture, they informed us that they could not supply the exact diameter 
threaded die cast boss part of the long life pots we asked them about.&nbsp; When we 
1<sup>st</sup> talked to this new pot vendor, one of the very 1<sup>st</sup> 
things we confirmed with them, is they could make the pots with the exact larger 
pot threaded boss we required and they said yes.&nbsp; The 1<sup>st</sup> generation 
Best CX30 Super pot had a smaller diameter metric threaded boss / post that fit thru the 
top CX30 paddle top case hole.&nbsp; So when you tightened down the pot locking nut 
(on the top paddle case), there was a good chance when paddle knob was 
installed, the sides of the paddle knob would drag on the inner lip of the CX30 
paddle top recess because under sized pot threaded boss was off center in the 
larger paddle top case mounting thru hole.&nbsp; So Best was determine to correct 
this undersize threaded boss on the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation Super Pots we 
made.&nbsp; When Best started to talk to this new Pot vendor about placing an order 
with them, they started to check to see if all of the very very old tooling 
(probably had not been used for 10 to 15+ years) to make all of the Long life 1 
meg pots different components was still in useable shape.&nbsp; They discovered the 
metal die cast mold to make the larger diameter pot threaded hub Best required 
was damaged and was no longer serviceable or repairable.&nbsp; The only die cast tool 
that was still useable was the exact same undersized threaded boss / hub as the 
1<sup>st</sup> generation Best CX30 Super POT.&nbsp; For Best this was </font></span>

<font size="5">Both the new Pot Suppler and Best both looked into making a new 
die mold that would make the exact diameter thread boss we required.&nbsp; All of the 
new tooling quotes that came in from the different die cast mold makers that 
were contacted in the Far East, said $,$$$ for a new mold and Minimum new 
production run of die cast hubs in the 50K to 60K part range.&nbsp; Again an extra 
cost that would make the new long life 1 meg CX30 Super Pots not cost effective 
to make or sell.&nbsp; Best studied this latest new long life Pot problem for a 
couple of more weeks. Then one day the Engineering solution to this latest pot 
problem was arrived at and would avoid starting to search for a new Pot vendor 
again.&nbsp; The Engineering compromise Best came up with was to make a slide over 
adapter metal bushing that would fit / slide over the undersized threaded Pot 
die cast boss and outside diameter of the adapter bushing would be the correct 
larger diameter to properly center the new long life pot thread hub into the 
Paddle top case thru hole.&nbsp; We asked the new pot vendor if they would find a 
local vendor to make this slide on adapter bushing.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later 
they said they found a local machine shop to make the adapter bushings.&nbsp; But the 
problem was the price per bushing that they came back was about 4 times what the 
bushing should cost.&nbsp; Again another extra high cost that would have to be added 
to the final cost of the new long life 1 meg Pots.&nbsp; Best has had much experience 
dealing with different Metal component suppliers here in Silicon Valley and we 
knew what this adapter bushing should cost.&nbsp; So Best decided to find a CNC 
Machine shop on our own who could make the 1 meg pot bushing we required.&nbsp; After 
a few weeks of searching thru many different CNC vendors, we find one who could 
make a new Stainless Steel bushing (aluminum bushing was to thin and would crush 
easily, a steel version would a second plating process cost, so Best decided to 
go with Stainless Steel version) required at a cost effective price.</font></span></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="5">So months and months dealing with this new and final Pot vendor, 
about mid March 2016 Best finally received the new Long life Super Pot samples 
to run to our Engineering and functional tests on.&nbsp; All of the sample Long life 
Super Pot 1<sup>st</sup> article samples passed all Atari CX30 Paddle tests, but 
there was one critical Atari CX30 Paddle Pot Dimension that was not to the 
Engineering print the Pot company sent to us in early January 2016.&nbsp; We brought 
this out of print specification to their attention.&nbsp; They said the print was 
wrong and they could not correct that last critical dimension problem without 
Best spending more money $,$$$ for another new Pot part mold.&nbsp; Best spend the 
next couple of week trying to finding a Engineering fix for this latest pot 
problem.&nbsp; In the end around April 1, 2016 Best made the decision to blow off 
this Pot vendor and start to search for another pot vendor all over again.</font></span></b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="5">About the second week in April 2016, after sorting thru more 
potential Pot vendors, one caught our attention.&nbsp; Their fast E-Mail responses to 
our E-Mails, answered all of the standard 25 to 35+ list of questions Best has 
learned to ask all new pot vendors for the last 19+ months of searching before 
we would even consider them as a possible new Pot supplier.&nbsp; One of the final 
critical questions we ask this new pot vendor, is if they could supply the new 
Long life Pots with the critical dimension that the last pot vendor could not.&nbsp; 
They said </font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial Black">
<font size="5">Yes</font></span><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="5">!&nbsp; 
So we asked them what the sample charge was going to cost.&nbsp; To our surprise 
their sample charge was about was about 1/10 (including the incoming sample 
shipping charges to Best) the cost of all of the other Pot vendors quoted us we 
have been in contact with for the last 19+ months.&nbsp; So in less than a half month 
of talking to this new Pot vendor, we sent the funds to the new vendor for some 
sample pots.&nbsp; With a week this new Pot vendor sent Best some pictures only of 
the 1<sup>st</sup> article sample pots that had just assembled up.&nbsp; We 
noticed a few features and some major dimensional problems&nbsp;on their 1st sample

<font size="5">One of the upgrade feature this new Pot vendor offered Best 
Electronics that no other Pot Vendor ever offered us in the last 10+ years of 
searching for CX30 Pots, was the ability to upgrade the soft black plastic pot shaft

CX30 Super Pot black plastic shafts.</font><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>&nbsp; 
The original CX30 Super pot manufacture could not find the right plastic 
diameter half shaft to fit the Atari CX30 Paddle knob.&nbsp; The only black shaft 
they could supply was too thick and the CX30 Paddle knob would not fit onto the 
half shaft diameter.&nbsp; Best almost had to give up on that 1st generation CX30 
Super Pot, until we came up the fix for that problem.&nbsp; We asked the Pot 
manufacture to sand down (on a belt sanding machine) each half shaft to required 
half shaft diameter to fit the CX30 Paddle knobs. </b></span></font><b>

<font size="5">A second feature Best always wanted to upgrade on the original 1<sup>st</sup> 
Generation CX30 Super Pots was the torque force to turn the Super Pot shaft / 
Paddle knob.&nbsp; On the 1<sup>st</sup> Generation Best CX30 Paddle Super pot, the 
torque force to turn the pot shaft / paddle knob ranged from very loose turning 
paddle knob, to a smooth turning knob, to a very buttery smooth turning Paddle Knob, 
like on a very very old expensive vacuum tube type of audio equipment volume 
control knob.&nbsp; Not a single Pot Vendor Best contracted for the last 8 to 10 
years of searching for a new 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> generation Pots, 
none said they could control the Torque force to turn the Pot Shaft / Paddle

One of the other items on the 1<sup>st</sup> Generation Best CX30 Super

thread situation required the original Atari Super Pot owners to wrap some 
masking tape around the bottom of the under sized (metric) threaded boss, so it would 
properly center in the top plastic CX30 Paddle top case larger mounting hole
